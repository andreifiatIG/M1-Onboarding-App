### Testing Strategy

#### Integration Test Suites
**Existing Test Files to Enhance**:
- `tests/electric-sql-integration.test.ts`
- `tests/microsoftGraph.test.ts`
- `tests/realTimeSync.test.ts`
- `tests/onboarding-wizard-comprehensive-test.ts`

#### Required Test Coverage
1. **End-to-End Onboarding Flow**: From villa creation to approval
2. **SharePoint Integration**: Document upload, folder creation, permissions
3. **Real-time Sync**: Multi-client data synchronization
4. **Admin Approval Workflow**: Complete approval/rejection flow
5. **Performance Testing**: Large dataset handling and concurrent users

### Current High-Priority Integration Tasks

#### 1. SharePoint Folder Management
**Issue**: Automated villa folder creation may not be properly integrated
**Required**: Ensure folder creation happens on villa creation/approval

#### 2. Real-time Progress Updates
**Issue**: Onboarding progress changes need real-time sync
**Required**: ElectricSQL integration for progress tracking

#### 3. Email Notification System  
**Issue**: Admin approval notifications may not be properly triggered
**Required**: Email integration for status changes

#### 4. Production Deployment
**Issue**: Docker configuration needs optimization for production
**Files**: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, deployment scripts
